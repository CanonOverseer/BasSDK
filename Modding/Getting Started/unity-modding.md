# Unity Modding

This guide will show you how to setup Unity and the BAS SDK as well as how to setup your project and export a mod.

## Unity Hub Install.

First thing is to download the [Unity Hub](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe) and install it.


## Unity Editor Install

Once installed, you then need to install the current Unity version BAS is using.
Generally having the same MAJOR.MINOR LTS version of Unity is fine. But for full compatability, try to use the same version BAS itself uses.

```tip
U11 uses 2020.3.33f1, but we can use the latest 2020.3 LTS version if necessary.
```

1. Open the Unity Hub.
2. Click Installs on the left side.
3. Click Install Editor.
4. Click Install next to `2020.3` `LTS` version of Unity.
    - If you are building mods for Nomad also check Android Build Support.
5. Click Install.

Unity will now download and install the editor.
