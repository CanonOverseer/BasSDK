# How to install mods for PCVR

In-game, you can go to the "Mods" section in the Main Menu, and install mods through this, which will be installed and updated automatically. These mods are uploaded from [Mod.io](https://mod.io/g/blade-and-sorcery).

## MANUAL INSTALL


1. Go to where the mods are uploaded, [Mod.io](https://mod.io/g/blade-and-sorcery), or [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/bladeandsorcery/mods/)

2. Open your B&S installation folder and go to StreamingAssets. The file path by default is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Blade & Sorcery\BladeAndSorcery_Data\StreamingAssets\Mods`

3. Drag your mod folder from the archive and drop it into `StreamingAssets\Mods`. Be sure to check that your mod folder is in `StreamingAssets\Mods` and not inside some subfolder.

   If you are seeing random numbers in your folder name, you have likely created a subfolder. Random subfolders can be accidentally created when extracting the folder from archive if you choose "extract to" instead of "extract here" or dragging the folder from the archive to the location.

4. Launch the game and your mod will be loaded. You will be able to see this on the `Downloaded Mods` section of the Mod manager in the main Menu

## COMMON MOD ISSUES

If your mods are not working in the game, here are the solutions to very common issues:

1. Ensure your mods are working for the version of Blade and Sorcery you have installed. Especially common when there is a big update, most mods will be obsolete and unplayable until the modder updates it. Most modders update to the latest version within a few days, but some mods may remain out of date and unusable if abandoned. If installed through the in-game mod manager, mods uploaded for the previous version will be automatically updated (if the modder has updated the mod), otherwise it will be disabled.

2. Make sure your mod folder is not in StreamingAssets\Mods and not inside a subfolder inside StreamingAssets\Mods. As mentioned in the install guide above, if you are seeing random numbers in your folder name you have likely installed your mod incorrectly and accidentally created a subfolder. https://i.imgur.com/AvpoJYH.png
