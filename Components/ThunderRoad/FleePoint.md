# FleePoint

Flee Points are points where enemies can despawn when they flee. When a [WaveSpawner][WaveSpawner] is created, a tickbox can be checked to create flee points based on where the spawn points are located, however you can use these gameobjects instead to specify despawn points.

Ensure that this GameObject is grounded for it to work correctly.
